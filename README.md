# cpp_game
Super simple game: You have to guess a code of digits. You will receive a hint what does numbers add and multiply to.  

1. Check if you have g++ (on mac) to compile game `g++ -v`
2. Checkout this repo
3. Run `g++ game.cpp -o game` to compile code into a binary
4. Run `./game` to start game


If you want to know the solutions remove the comment before `std::cout << CodeA << CodeB << CodeC`
